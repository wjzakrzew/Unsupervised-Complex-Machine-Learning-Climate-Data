# Climate Data- Unsupervised & Complex Machine Learning in Python
Analyzed climate data on 15 weather stations across Europe predicting pleasant vs. unpleasant days.
Employed various Unsupervised, Deep Learning, and Complex Keras Models.

## Summary
This modeling was conducted for ClimateWins on weather station data across 15 European Cities.
Various opportunities to evalauted hyperparameters, visual applications, and complex machine learning techniques.

## Data
Data was from the European Climate Assessment & Dataset Project (ECA&D) collected by the European Environment Agency (EEA).
Code related to the python analysis can be found in this repository.
